# Data Visualizations/Explorations for my Independent Deepfake Detection Research

This is a segement of the code where I download and sort a collection of 20,000 human generated images and 60,000 AI generated images and plot various parts of the data to determine patterns between the color intensity, brightness values, and gradient magnitudes.

## Features

- pre-processes data and downloads dataset from kaggle
- accesses, stores, and graphs average red color intensity per image (for ai generated vs. real images)
- accesses, stores, and graphs average blue color intensity per image (for ai generated vs. real images)
- accesses, stores, and graphs average green color intensity per image (for ai generated vs. real images)
- accesses, stores, and graphs average brightness per image (for ai generated vs. real images)
- accesses, stores, and graphs gradient magnitude per image (for ai generated vs. real images)

## Requirements to use
- cannot be used without importing all neccesary libraries referenced in the code
- cannot be used without downloading kaggle dataset
